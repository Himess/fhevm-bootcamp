# Module 01: Introduction to FHE

## Overview

This module introduces the theory of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and explains why it is a breakthrough for blockchain privacy. You will learn the fundamentals of encryption, understand the different types of homomorphic encryption, compare FHE with other privacy solutions, and discover how Zama's fhEVM brings FHE to Solidity smart contracts. This is a theory-only module -- no code is required.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
2. Define homomorphic encryption and describe what makes it unique.
3. Distinguish between PHE, SHE, and FHE.
4. Explain what TFHE (Torus FHE) is and why Zama chose it.
5. Articulate the privacy problem on public blockchains.
6. Compare FHE with ZK-Proofs, MPC, and TEE as privacy solutions.
