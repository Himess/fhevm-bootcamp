- The capstone on Day 5 is a "mini-capstone" -- a simplified version that demonstrates core competency.
- For a more thorough experience, extend to 7 days and give applications and capstone full time.
- Instructor-led cohorts should have TAs available for individual debugging support.
- Evening "office hours" (optional 21:00-22:00) are recommended for students who need extra help.

### Part-Time Path Notes

- Each evening session starts with a 15-minute review of the previous session.
- Weekend sessions include a 30-minute break at the midpoint.
- If you fall behind, use the following week's evening sessions to catch up and shift the schedule.
- Pair programming with a study partner is strongly recommended for the Part-Time path.
- Module 13 (DeFi Primitives) is condensed to 2 hours; focus on the order book exercise and skim the lending/AMM content.
- The capstone project scope should be adjusted for the Part-Time path -- aim for a focused, well-tested contract rather than a multi-contract system.

## Path 3: Self-Paced

**Total Hours:** ~63 hours
**Suggested Duration:** 6-12 weeks

### Self-Paced Path Notes

- There is no external deadline, but setting personal deadlines dramatically improves completion rates.
- Aim for at least 2 study sessions per week to maintain momentum.
- Use the quizzes as genuine self-assessments. If you score below 70%, review the material before proceeding.
- Join the Zama community forums (community.zama.ai) to ask questions and connect with other learners.
- The resources directory (cheatsheet, common pitfalls, gas guide) is your reference library -- use it actively.
- If you get stuck on a module for more than 2 sessions, skip to the next module and return later. Sometimes later material clarifies earlier confusion.
- Consider finding a study partner or forming a small group even in self-paced mode.

## Transitioning Between Paths

You can switch paths at any time. The module structure is the same regardless of path.

- **Intensive to Part-Time:** If Day 5 feels rushed, switch to Part-Time for the application modules (Weeks 3-4).
- **Part-Time to Self-Paced:** If you miss a week, switch to Self-Paced and pick up where you left off.
- **Self-Paced to Intensive:** If you complete Phases A-B on your own, join an intensive cohort starting from Day 4 for the advanced and application modules.

## Recommended Study Habits

1. **Active coding:** Type every example yourself. Do not copy-paste from notes.
2. **Break the code:** After completing an exercise, intentionally introduce bugs and observe the behavior.
3. **Explain it:** After each module, explain the key concept to someone (or rubber duck). If you cannot explain it simply, review the material.
4. **Reference the cheatsheet:** Keep `resources/CHEATSHEET.md` open while coding.
5. **Review before proceeding:** Spend the first 15 minutes of each session reviewing the previous module's key points.
6. **Build incrementally:** Do not try to build the entire capstone at once. Start with a minimal contract and add features.
