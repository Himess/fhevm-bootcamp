# Submission TODOs

## Completed
- [x] 4-week program structure with weekly milestones (across entire repo)
- [x] Weekly homework assignments with grading criteria

## TODO (Manual / Later)
- [ ] **Demonstration Video (REQUIRED)** — Max 5 minutes. Overview of curriculum, walkthrough of one sample lesson, homework design philosophy. Must be recorded and submitted.
- [ ] **Interactive Learning Platform** — Current site is static landing page. Consider embedding lesson content directly on the website instead of linking to GitHub.
- [ ] **Video Content** — "Learning resources in any form: videos, slides" — slides exist, adding walkthrough videos would strengthen submission.
